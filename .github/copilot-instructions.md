Hi Copilot!

This is a site for users to be able to see stats on certain situations in board games. Here are some importaint points:
- Hosted on Github pages so it is a static site but it has flexable options.
- Community driven, all descisions need to be easy for anyone and everyone to interact with/do. It would be cool to add in some optional nerdy features though.
- /gameData is where all the games and gameData are stored
- /js is all the logic and has a few self-explanitory subfolders
